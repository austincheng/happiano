		Happy 26th birthday! I know you don't like talking about our age gap and getting old, but I like to think about it as us growing older and \
		learning together, our love getting stronger, and experiencing life together, forming fond memories, and writing the most beautiful and precious \
		life story there will ever be. Ever since the very first moment I met you, you've brought an immense amount of joy into my life and you truly changed my \
		life for the better, being my sturdy support in every situation, guiding me through struggles and life, and shaping my personality and behavior into \
		a better person. I always like to think back to the moment we met and before we got together and wonder how such a seemingly innocent meeting flourished \
		into the sweetest relationship we have now. The more I think about it, the less I need to wonder, since it seems like we are meant to be together and that \
		it was always going to turn out this way, as us being together is the way things are supposed to be. It really feels as if life, fate, and everything in \
		the world is pulling us together, and we always find our way back to each other, and no matter what happens, we always end up loving each other more than ever. \
		You really are the perfect key to my lock, and you are the only person who can open the door to my heart. 

		I really appreciate how patient you are with me \
		when I don't act like the way you are used to, and how you are so accepting of my many quirks, and how you are always there for me and supporting me when \
		I'm having a tough time. This is especially true when we are in groups, and I know my introvert self often behaves very differently than the average person, so \
		I'm very thankful that you are always by my side, talking for me and leading and guiding me through social situations. You always think about me and take so \
		much care of my feelings, defending and comforting me in any situation. You are also very open to feedback and always take into consideration my thoughts, and I \
		see how hard you try to improve our relationship and make me happy. I'm truly very appreciative and emotional that I have someone like you in my life \
		who cares so much about me. I also appreciate when you teach me new things, when you are very willing to share everything about you and your days, when you \
		show me new fun activities to do together, and how comfortable, open, and honest you are when you are around me. You also do so much for me, like cooking for me, \
		buying and picking clothes for me, doing chores around the house, cutting my hair, and there really are an endless amount of things I'm grateful for. \
		You also take care of me when I'm not feeling well, when I get injured, or the very rare times I get drunk, and I honestly can't appreciate you enough \
		for everything you do for me. You truly are the most generous, caring, supportive, fun, talented, smart, savvy, candid, patient person I've ever met, and I \
		can't find a suitable way to describe you other than the best and perfect girlfriend. It continuously amazes me more and more of how much of a perfect \
		girlfriend you are, and somehow you just keep getting better and better. 

		You really entered my life at the perfect time and I'll be forever grateful that you did, \
		as I finally feel like a big hole in my life has been filled. Ever since we started texting and getting to know each other more, you were always \
		willing to accompany me and spend so much time out of your day to make me happy. I'm generally very shy, not great at social interactions, and slow at \
		texting, but you were very patient with me, and you make me feel comfortable to talk with you and be around you, slowly bringing me out of my shell from \
		texting to voice messages to phone calls to video calls to face-to-face interactions. I often feel socially anxious and overthink a lot of things when \
		I'm around other people, which is why I also don't like texting too much, but you completely changed everything for me. You were one of the first people \
		I actually enjoyed texting with, and nowadays I feel like you're the only person in the world with whom I can truly be myself around. Sometimes it feels as if \
		you're not really another person, but rather an extension of myself, a part of me that I was missing for most of my life, so it's so easy to be myself around you \
		since I don't have any of the worries I usually have in social situations. This has also extended to my everyday life, especially when I'm around you, where \
		I start to feel less and less shy, as you are always so encouraging and supportive, and it makes me feel more confident about myself. You always believe in me \
		and never judge me for any of my strange behaviors, and it makes my life so much less anxious. 

		Nowadays, when we are together with other people, I'm so overwhelmed \
		by our love that I no longer feel shy and feel like our love is the one part of my life I never want to hide. Nothing else matters when I'm with you, and I often \
		completely lose track of our surroundings and only want to focus on you and our love. Sometimes I remember how amazing of a girlfriend you are and just lose \
		myself in your eyes and keep staring at you in public, especially after a day of not seeing you. In those moments I just completely forget that I'm usually shy, \
		and a lot of the times when we do something affectionately in public, I think it's funny how it often ends up with you being more shy than me. When you're not around, \
		I really can't stop thinking about you and thinking about how much I love you, so when you are with me, I feel like I want to keep saying I love you, and it's often \
		hard to resist saying it in front of other people. The times that we are together are always so fond, sweet, and affectionate and even though we spend a lot \
		of time together already, it never fails to make me happy and it always leaves me longing for more. It really feels like everyday is our honeymoon, as I somehow \
		fall in love with you again and again everyday. 

		Your personality is so positive and outgoing that you make everyone's lives around you so much better, and your beauty, \
		cuteness, and bubbly behavior makes everyone want to get close to you. I know for me it's often hard to stop staring and admiring your personality and beauty, and I \
		feel like the luckiest person in the world because I get to enjoy your presence the most, and no matter how much time I spend with you, I always feel like it's never enough \
		and I'll never get tired of it. Because I keep wanting to spend time with you, I remember always trying to find excuses to try to get more time with you, and I wanted to \
		actively find romantic activities to do together. However, eventually I realized that it really doesn't matter what we're doing, as our power of love is so strong that \
		we always find ways to make anything romantic, sweet, and affectionate. I started to enjoy even the simple things and even the things that I never liked to do. I'm so happy \
		that I have someone who is willing to spend all this time with me and keep putting up with me, and anytime I want do something, no matter how simple or how complex it is, you \
		always agree. I keep imagining our bright future as I envision spending everyday with you, enjoying every part of life with you.

		Through our many activities and time we spent together, we have formed so many loving memories and I always find it enjoyable to look back and think about \
		our experiences together. One of our most beloved activites is playing music together, whether it be playing piano or singing duets, and in honor of this, I have placed \
		a virtual piano below so that we can play and practice from anywhere. We are writing the best life story ever together, and I hope you enjoy this journey through our life story so far \
		with stories told through our songs or inspired by our songs. I am looking forward to writing every single 夕 with you into our life story until eternity.

		`生活跟整個世界一直在把我們拉在一起，所以我們一定能找到彼此，然後不管怎麼樣，我們永遠會越來越愛。你真的是我的鎖的最完美的鑰匙，你是世界上唯一個人` +
		`能打開我的心門。

		 我很感謝寶貝會對我有很多耐心，尤其是有些時候我的行為比較不正常，你也接受我的每一個缺點，我有困難的時候你也永遠在我身邊支持我。尤其是我們跟朋友` +
		`在一起的時候，我知道我比較內向所以有些行為比較不正常，我就很感謝你永遠在我旁邊，也會幫我講話然後跟我一起面對社交場合。你總是會想到我跟考慮我的` +
		`情緒，在每一個情況下都會保護跟安慰我。你也很願意聽我的想法跟意見，我看得出來你多努力的想要改善我們的關係和想辦法讓我開心。我真的很感謝很感動在我生活裡` +

		`我一直都不知道你怎麼可能可以又這麼完美，又每天還是變越來越好。

		 你進入我的生活真的讓我很幸福，因為你填補我生活裡的一個大洞。從我們開始認識用簡訊聊天，你一直都很願意陪我然後花很多時間讓我開心。我通常比較內向不太會社交，不太會` +
		`發簡訊所以也發簡訊比較慢，但是你對我很有耐心，然後慢慢的讓我跟你很自在的相處跟聊天，從簡訊到語音到電話到視訊到面對面相處。我平常不太喜歡很多社會的相處也不喜歡` +
		`簡訊，因為很多東西我會想太多或者擔心然後讓我緊張，但是跟你在一起我變得完全不一樣。跟你我真的很喜歡用簡訊聊天，然後現在我覺得你是世界上唯一的人我相處的時候可以真的做自己。` +
		`有時候就感覺你不是一個不同的人，而是我自己以前缺的一部分，所以就很容易做自己因為我不用擔心我平常社交會擔心的。這個也影響我的平常生活，尤其是你在的時候，我變得越來越不害羞` +
		`因為你永遠支持我也很鼓勵我，所以讓我對自己有多的自信。你永遠對我有信心而且不會覺得我奇怪，就讓我的生活變得比較輕鬆。

		 現在我們在一起我覺得我們充滿的愛，我就覺得不害羞然後我們的愛是我唯一的一部分我從來不想藏。我跟你在一起的時候其他的東西都不重要，我就想一直專心愛你。` +

		`在一起永遠很親密很親熱很甜，就算我們花很多時間在一起我還是一直都很開心，一直想要更多時間。感覺像每天都是我們的蜜月，然後每天又重新愛上你。

		 你的個性很外向很活潑就讓大家都很開心讓大家的生活變得更好，你的美麗可愛跟活潑行為讓大家都想靠近你。我自己也覺得很難不看你，我就想一直享受你的美麗跟性格，` +
		`於是就覺得我是世界上最幸運的人可以欣賞你的存在最多。不管我跟你花多少時間，我覺得永遠不夠然後跟你永遠不會累永遠不會看膩。因為我一直想跟你花更多時間，我記得我以前` +
		`一直找藉口可以跟你花更多時間，也想找一些比較浪漫的活動可以跟你一起做。不過我後來發現跟你做什麼不重要，只要你在我們的愛情的力量就會想辦法讓我們變很浪漫很甜很親密。` +
		`跟你在一起我都開始享受很簡單的東西，甚至開始喜歡我以前討厭的事。我真的很開心很幸福有你願意每天陪我花很多時間然後一直包容我，不管我想做什麼你都願意。我一直想像我們` +

		 我們找了很多活動可以一起做然後就做了許多的回憶，我很喜歡回想到我們的生活的故事跟經驗。其中的一個活動是我們的音樂活動，像唱歌跟彈鋼琴，所以為了紀念這些好玩的時候，我底下放了` +
		`一個電子鋼琴所以我們從哪裡都可以彈琴練琴。我們在一起寫最美好的生活故事，所以希望你可以跟我一起享受回憶我們的生活故事，用我們的歌來說我們的故事。我非常期待跟你寫我們的每一夕` +
		`到我們的生活故事裡直到永恆。
